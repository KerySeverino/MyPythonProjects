A collection of python projects developed over 100 days as part of my coding journey to improve my Python programming skills.
Each project is categorized by difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and serves as a valuable resource for both learners and experienced developers. 
Thank you for accompanying me on this journey.
